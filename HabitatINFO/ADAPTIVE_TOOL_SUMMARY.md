# Adaptive Critical Habitat Map Tool

## Overview

The new `generate_adaptive_critical_habitat_map` tool provides intelligent, location-aware critical habitat mapping with comprehensive analysis capabilities. This tool automatically determines the optimal map buffer based on habitat proximity and provides detailed regulatory analysis.

## Key Features

### üéØ Adaptive Buffer Sizing
- **Within Habitat**: Uses 0.5-mile buffer for detailed view
- **Near Habitat**: Uses distance to nearest habitat + 1 mile buffer
- **No Nearby Habitat**: Uses 2-mile regional overview buffer

### üîç Comprehensive Analysis
- Point-in-polygon habitat detection
- Distance calculation to nearest critical habitat
- Detailed species identification and analysis
- Regulatory implications assessment
- Professional recommendations

### üìä Detailed Output
- High-quality PDF maps with appropriate scale
- Complete habitat analysis results
- Species-specific information
- Regulatory compliance guidance
- Next steps recommendations

## Tool Functionality

### Input Parameters
```python
@tool
def generate_adaptive_critical_habitat_map(
    longitude: float,           # Longitude coordinate (decimal degrees)
    latitude: float,            # Latitude coordinate (decimal degrees)
    location_name: Optional[str] = None,        # Optional location name
    base_map: str = "World_Imagery",            # Base map style
    include_proposed: bool = True,              # Include proposed habitat
    include_legend: bool = True,                # Include legend
    habitat_transparency: float = 0.8           # Habitat layer transparency
) -> str:
```

### Analysis Process

1. **Habitat Detection**
   - Performs point-in-polygon analysis using CriticalHabitatClient
   - Queries both final and proposed habitat layers
   - Identifies all species with habitat at the location

2. **Distance Calculation** (if not within habitat)
   - Searches within 50-mile radius for nearest habitat
   - Calculates precise distance to habitat boundary
   - Identifies nearest habitat species and details

3. **Buffer Determination**
   - Within habitat: 0.5 miles (detailed view)
   - Near habitat: distance + 1 mile (ensures habitat visibility)
   - No nearby habitat: 2 miles (regional context)

4. **Map Generation**
   - Uses optimized print service configuration
   - Applies calculated buffer for appropriate scale
   - Includes professional legend and attribution

5. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Species identification and grouping
   - Final vs proposed designation analysis
   - Regulatory implications assessment
   - Tailored recommendations

## Use Cases

### 1. Project Planning
- Automatically determines if ESA consultation is required
- Provides species-specific information for impact assessment
- Generates appropriate maps for regulatory submissions

### 2. Environmental Compliance
- Documents habitat presence/absence with precise analysis
- Provides regulatory guidance and next steps
- Creates professional maps for compliance documentation

### 3. Site Assessment
- Intelligent buffer sizing ensures relevant habitat is visible
- Comprehensive species analysis for impact evaluation
- Distance calculations for alternative site consideration

### 4. Regulatory Consultation
- Detailed species and unit information for USFWS coordination
- Professional maps suitable for consultation packages
- Clear regulatory implications and requirements

## Technical Implementation

### Integration with Existing Tools
- Uses proven `CriticalHabitatMapGenerator` for map creation
- Leverages `CriticalHabitatClient` for detailed analysis
- Applies successful wetlands implementation patterns

### Distance Calculation Algorithm
- Haversine formula for accurate distance measurement
- Polygon boundary analysis for precise habitat edges

## Testing

Run the test script to validate functionality:

```bash
python HabitatINFO/test_adaptive_tool.py
```

Test scenarios include:
- Locations within critical habitat
- Locations near but outside habitat
- Locations with no nearby habitat
- Multiple species scenarios
