# Critical Habitat Polygon Layer Display Fix

## Problem
The critical habitat map generator was not displaying polygon layers in the output PDFs, even though the service was accessible and contained data.

## Root Cause Analysis
After comparing the working wetlands map generator with the critical habitat implementation, three key differences were identified:

### 1. Print Service URL
- **Original (not working)**: `https://utility.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Utilities/PrintingTools/GPServer/Export%20Web%20Map%20Task/execute`
- **Fixed (working)**: `https://fwsprimary.wim.usgs.gov/server/rest/services/ExportWebMap/GPServer/Export%20Web%20Map/execute`

### 2. Layer Configuration Pattern
- **Original (not working)**: Multiple separate layer configurations, each with its own `visibleLayers` array
- **Fixed (working)**: Single layer configuration with combined `visibleLayers` array

### 3. Scale Calculation
- **Original**: Used max scale of 500,000
- **Fixed**: Used max scale of 250,000 (same as wetlands for consistency)

## Solution Implementation

### Before (Multiple Layer Approach)
```python
layer_configs = []

# Final polygon features
layer_configs.append({
    "id": "final_polygon_habitat",
    "url": self.habitat_service_url,
    "title": "Critical Habitat - Final Designations (Polygon)",
    "opacity": habitat_transparency,
    "visibility": True,
    "layerType": "ArcGISMapServiceLayer",
    "visibleLayers": [0],
    "minScale": 0,
    "maxScale": 0
})

# Final linear features
layer_configs.append({
    "id": "final_linear_habitat",
    "url": self.habitat_service_url,
    "title": "Critical Habitat - Final Designations (Linear)",
    "opacity": habitat_transparency,
    "visibility": True,
    "layerType": "ArcGISMapServiceLayer",
    "visibleLayers": [1],
    "minScale": 0,
    "maxScale": 0
})

# ... more layers for proposed habitat
```

### After (Single Layer Approach)
```python
# Determine which habitat layers to show - using wetlands pattern
visible_layers = [0, 1]  # Always include final polygon and linear features

# Include proposed habitat if requested
if include_proposed:
    visible_layers.extend([2, 3])  # Add proposed polygon and linear features

# Create single critical habitat operational layer with proper configuration
habitat_layer = {
    "id": "critical_habitat_layer",
    "url": self.habitat_service_url,
    "title": "USFWS Critical Habitat",
    "opacity": habitat_transparency,
    "visibility": True,
    "layerType": "ArcGISMapServiceLayer",
    "visibleLayers": visible_layers,
    "minScale": 0,
    "maxScale": 0
}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Changed print service URL** to use the same USFWS WIM service as the working wetlands implementation
2. **Consolidated layer configuration** to use a single layer with multiple `visibleLayers` instead of multiple separate layers
3. **Applied consistent scale calculation** using the same max scale limit as wetlands (250,000)
4. **Updated legend configuration** to reference the single layer ID

## Results

After implementing these changes:
- ✅ Polygon layers now display correctly in PDF output
- ✅ File sizes are reasonable (400KB+ for typical maps)
- ✅ Maps include both polygon and linear critical habitat features
- ✅ Legend displays properly
- ✅ Both final and proposed designations work correctly

## Testing

The fix was validated using locations with known critical habitat:
- **Texas Coast (Whooping Crane)**: -96.7970, 28.1595 ✅
- **Colorado River (Fish)**: -114.0719, 36.1699 ✅

## Lessons Learned

1. **Service compatibility matters**: Different print services may have different capabilities and requirements
2. **Layer configuration patterns**: The way layers are structured in the Web Map JSON can significantly affect rendering
3. **Follow working patterns**: When one implementation works, adopt its patterns for similar services
4. **Test with real data**: Always test with locations that actually contain the expected features
