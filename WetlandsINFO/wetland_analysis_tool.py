Comprehensive Wetland Analysis Tool

This module provides a single comprehensive tool that combines wetland data querying
and adaptive map generation for a given coordinate point.

The tool:
1. Analyzes if the coordinate point is within a wetland
2. If not in wetland, identifies wetlands within 0.5-mile radius
3. Provides detailed wetland information and classifications
4. Generates an adaptive wetland map based on the analysis
5. Returns comprehensive results including both data and map

Tool:
- analyze_wetland_location_with_map: Complete wetland analysis with adaptive map generation

    Comprehensive wetland analysis tool that combines data querying and adaptive map generation.
    
    This tool performs a complete wetland assessment:
    
    1. **Point Analysis**: Determines if the coordinate point is within a wetland
    2. **Radius Search**: If not in wetland, searches for wetlands within 0.5-mile radius
    3. **Wetland Details**: Provides comprehensive information about identified wetlands including:
       - NWI classifications and codes
       - Wetland types and characteristics
       - Areas and distances
       - Regulatory implications
    4. **Adaptive Map**: Generates an intelligent map with optimal settings based on analysis:
       - Automatic buffer sizing based on wetland proximity
       - Appropriate base map selection
       - Optimal transparency settings
       - Professional legend and scale
    
    Data Sources:
    - USFWS National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)
    - EPA RIBITS (Regulatory In-lieu fee and Bank Information Tracking System)
    - EPA National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)
    - USFWS Riparian Mapping
