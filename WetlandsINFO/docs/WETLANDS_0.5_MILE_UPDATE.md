# WetlandsINFO 0.5 Mile Radius Update

## Overview
The WetlandsINFO query tool has been updated to always check for wetlands within a 0.5 mile radius when analyzing point coordinates, regardless of whether wetlands are found at the exact location.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `query_wetland_location.py`

#### Updated `analyze_location` method:
- Now always searches for wetlands within 0.5 mile radius after checking the exact location
- If wetlands are found at the exact location, nearby wetlands are still searched but duplicates are filtered out
- Results show both wetlands at the exact location and additional wetlands within 0.5 miles

#### Added `_find_wetlands_in_radius` method:
- New method specifically for searching wetlands within a fixed radius
- Takes radius as a parameter (default 0.5 miles)
- Returns wetlands with distance and bearing information
- Filters results to only include wetlands within the specified radius

#### Updated Summary Report:
- Now displays "Wetlands within 0.5 mile radius" section for point queries
- Shows count of wetlands found within the radius in the regulatory implications
- Updated status messages to include radius information

### 2. Fixed Layer Issue in `wetlands_client.py`

Changed from layer 1 to layer 0 for NWI wetlands queries:
- Layer 0: Actual wetlands features
- Layer 1: Project metadata (was incorrectly returning project boundaries)

## Usage

The tool now provides more comprehensive wetland information by default:

```bash
# Point analysis - will check exact location AND 0.5 mile radius
python query_wetland_location.py -66.199399 18.408303 "Test Location" save

# Polygon analysis - unchanged, checks within polygon boundaries
python extract_and_test_polygon.py
```

## Benefits

1. **More Comprehensive Analysis**: Users get information about nearby wetlands even if none exist at the exact location
2. **Better Planning**: The 0.5 mile radius helps identify potential indirect impacts and buffer requirements
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many regulations require consideration of wetlands within a certain distance
4. **Consistent Results**: All point queries now use the same search radius

## Example Output

When wetlands are found at the exact location:
- Shows wetlands at location
- Also searches and displays additional wetlands within 0.5 miles (excluding duplicates)

When no wetlands at exact location:
- Shows "No wetlands at exact coordinates"
- Displays any wetlands found within 0.5 mile radius with distance and bearing

## Technical Details

- Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculations
- Filters duplicate wetlands by comparing wetland IDs
- Limits results to 10 nearest wetlands to avoid overwhelming output
