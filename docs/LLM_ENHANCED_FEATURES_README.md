## üìö Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Report Generation

```python
from llm_enhanced_report_generator import EnhancedComprehensiveReportGenerator

# Initialize with LLM capabilities
generator = EnhancedComprehensiveReportGenerator(
    data_directory="your/data/directory",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    use_llm=True
)

# Generate enhanced report
report = generator.generate_enhanced_comprehensive_report()

# Export with LLM enhancements
json_file = generator.export_enhanced_report_to_json()
md_file = generator.export_enhanced_report_to_markdown()
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Basic enhanced report
python llm_enhanced_report_generator.py /path/to/data --format both

# Specify different model
python llm_enhanced_report_generator.py /path/to/data --model gpt-4o

# Disable LLM for fallback mode
python llm_enhanced_report_generator.py /path/to/data --no-llm
```

### Programmatic Data Access

```python
# Extract enhanced data components
enhanced_data = generator.extract_with_llm_enhancement()

# Access AI-generated risk assessment
if enhanced_data.get('enhanced_risk'):
    risk = enhanced_data['enhanced_risk']
    print(f"Risk Level: {risk.risk_level}")
    print(f"Complexity Score: {risk.complexity_score}/12")
    print(f"Key Factors: {risk.key_risk_factors}")
    print(f"AI Reasoning: {risk.reasoning}")

# Access LLM-generated summaries
if enhanced_data.get('llm_summaries'):
    summaries = enhanced_data['llm_summaries']
    print(f"Integrated Assessment: {summaries.integrated_assessment}")
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Model Selection

The generator supports various OpenAI models through LangChain's `init_chat_model`:

- **`gpt-4o-mini`** (Default) - Fast and cost-effective
- **`gpt-4o`** - More capable, slower, higher cost
- **`gpt-3.5-turbo`** - Alternative option for basic enhancement

### LLM Settings

```python
generator = EnhancedComprehensiveReportGenerator(
    data_directory="data/",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Model selection
    use_llm=True               # Enable/disable LLM features
)
```

### Fallback Behavior

The enhanced generator gracefully falls back to standard processing if:
- OpenAI API key is not available
- Network connectivity issues occur
- LLM initialization fails
- API rate limits are exceeded
